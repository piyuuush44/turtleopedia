        "text": "Introduction to REST APIs\nIf you're new to executing AJAX requests, chances are you may be new to REST APIs in general. This crash course is going to be fast and rough around the edges, so strap in.\n\nIn the most simple sense, a REST API endpoint is a URL. It just so happens that this URL probably expects more from you than simply visiting it, and as a result, should output something useful for you. API Endpoints will almost always output either JSON or XML; these responses will give you information varying from error codes to the actual data you seek.\n\nREST APIs expect requests to come in one of the following forms:\n\nGET: A request looking for read-only data. Some GET requests simply need to be copy and pasted into a browser window to receive results, but usually we need to either authenticate or specify what we're looking for.\nPOST: A write request to the target resource. Expects that new information will come as a result of this request.\nPUT: Updates pre-existing data somewhere, likely in some database.\nPATCH: Somewhat similar to PUT, and in my experience rarely used at all.\nDELETE: Expects that information will be deleted as a result of the request.\n\nAJAX Call\nGo get started with an API key over at LinkPreview if you're following along. I'm going to assume you already have JQuery readily available from here forward.\n\nTo get started, we'll wait for our document to load, and set two critical variables: the API URL, and our API key.\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n});\nSet API endpoint and key\nIf you're following along what we've done with Lynx Roundups, our next step is to get all the relevant <a> tags on a page, loop through them, and replace them with their respective link previews.\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n  \n  $( \".content a\" ).each(function( index, element ) {\n      console.log($( this ).text());\n  }\n});\nThe JQuery .each method creates a loop which iterates over every element matching the provided selector. In our example, we only want <a> tags in the content of our page; otherwise we would get all links, like navigation links and so forth.\n\nNow it's time to bring in that $.ajax() thing we've been going off about.\n\n$( document ).ready(function() {\n  var api_url = 'https://api.linkpreview.net'\n  var key = '5b578yg9yvi8sogirbvegoiufg9v9g579gviuiub8' // not real\n\n  $( \".content a\" ).each(function( index, element ) {\n\n    $.ajax({\n        url: api_url + \"?key=\" + key + \" &q=\" + $( this ).text(),\n        contentType: \"application/json\",\n        dataType: 'json',\n        success: function(result){\n            console.log(result);\n        }\n    })\n  });\n});\nHTTP requests with Ajax\nThis is how Ajax request are structured: the contents of $.ajax() is essentially an object taking values it will use to construct the request. The above example is about as simple as it gets for making a barebones GET call. We're looping through each <a> tag and passing its contents (the url) to the API, and receiving an object in response.\n\nAjax requests can take way more parameters than the ones we just specified. I recommend reading over the JQuery Ajax documentation closely; not only for the sake of these requests, but understanding the potential items we can specify will solidify an understanding for REST APIs in general.\n\nThe line contentType: \"application/json\" specifies that the content coming back to us will be in JSON format - this is a very common header when dealing with REST APIs.",

        "text": "Most operating systems are multi-threaded and hence can handle multiple operations executing in the background. When one of these operations is completed, the kernel tells Node.js and the respective callback assigned to that operation is added to the event queue which will eventually be executed. This will be explained further in detail later in this topic.\n\nFeatures of Event Loop:\n\nEvent loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks.\nThe event loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task.\nThe event loop allows us to use callbacks and promises.\nThe event loop executes the tasks starting from the oldest first.\nExample:\n\nfilter_none\nbrightness_4\nconsole.log(\"This is the first statement\"); \n   \nsetTimeout(function(){ \n    console.log(\"This is the second statement\"); \n}, 1000); \n   \nconsole.log(\"This is the third statement\");  \nOutput:\nThis is the first statement\nThis is the third statement\nThis is the second statement\nExplanation: In the above example, the first console log statement is pushed to the call stack and “This is the first statement” is logged on the console and the task is popped from the stack. Next, the setTimeout is pushed to the queue and the task is sent to the Operating system and the timer is set for the task. This task is then popped from the stack. Next, the third console log statement is pushed to the call stack and “This is the third statement” is logged on the console and the task is popped from the stack.\n\nWhen the timer set by setTimeout function (in this case 1000 ms) runs out, the callback is sent to the event queue. The event loop on finding the call stack empty takes the task at the top of the event queue and sends it to the call stack. The callback function for setTimeout function runs the instruction and “This is the second statement” is logged on the console and the task is popped from the stack.\n\nNote: In the above case, if the timeout was set to 0ms then also the statements will be displayed in the same order. This is because although the callback with be immediately sent to the event queue, the event loop won’t send it to the call stack unless the call stack is empty i.e. until the provided input script comes to an end.\n\nWorking of the Event loop: When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop, processes the provided input script which may make async API calls, schedule timers, then begins processing the event loop. In the previous example, the initial input script consisted of console.log() statements and a setTimeout() function which schedules a timer.\n\nWhen using Node.js, a special library module called libuv is used to perform async operations. This library is also used, together with the back logic of Node, to manage a special thread pool called the libuv thread pool.This thread pool is composed of four threads used to delegate operations that are too heavy for the event loop. I/O operations, Opening and closing connections, setTimeouts are the example of such operations.\n\nWhen the thread pool completes a task, a callback function is called which handles the error(if any) or does some other operation. This callback function is sent to the event queue. When the call stack is empty, the event goes through the event queue and sends the callback to the call stack.",

ReCaptcha’s founders, Luis von Ahn and Ben Maurer, estimate that about 60 million CAPTCHAs are solved every day.

Earlier, users would have to manually create a wireless network name (SSID), and then manually enter the security key on both the access point and client to prevent unwanted access to their wireless&nbsp;network. This whole process requires tasks that need knowledge of the WiFi devices and various configuration changes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>WPS can be Enabled as follows:</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>– &gt; PBC (Push button configuration) Method</strong>, in which the user simply has to push a button on both WPS enabled devices to connect.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>– &gt; PIN (Personal Identification Number) Method</strong>, in which a PIN has to be entered in the AP or client WPS device&nbsp;to connect.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">With WPS, it will automatically configure a wireless network&nbsp;with a network name (SSID) and strong WPA data encryption and authentication. WPS is designed to support&nbsp;various WiFi certified 802.11 products ranging from access points, wireless adapters, WiFi phones, and other&nbsp;consumer electronics devices.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Advantages of WPS</strong></p><ul><li>WPS automatically configures the network name (SSID) and WPA security key for the access point and the&nbsp;WPS enabled client devices on a network.</li><li>No need to know the SSID and security key or passphrase when connecting to WPS-enabled devices.</li><li>Hard to guess the security key or passphrase because the keys will be randomly generated.</li><li>No predictable passphrase or long sequences of hexadecimal to enter.</li><li>Information and network credentials are securely exchanged over the air using the Extensible&nbsp;Authentication Protocol (EAP), one of the authentication protocols used in WPA2.</li><li>WPS has been integrated and supported in Windows Vista.</li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Disadvantages of WPS</strong></p><ul><li>It does not support the “ad hoc” mode or network where wireless devices are communicated directly to each&nbsp;other without an access point.</li><li>All of the WiFi devices on the network must be WPS certified or WPS-compatible, otherwise, you will not&nbsp;be able to take advantage of the ease of securing the network.</li><li>Difficult to add a non-WPS client device to the network because of the long sequences of hexadecimal<br>characters generated by the WPS technology.</li><li>This technology is fairly new, so not every vendor will support WPS technology.</li></ul><h3 style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Exploiting WPS:</h3><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Step 1: Check for WPS enabled devices using the terminal by using command “wash -i &nbsp;[interface name]” without quotes after putting your wireless card on monitor mode.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Step 2: Download and install reaver if not already installed</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Step 3: Run below command to exploit :</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reaver -b [AP Mac] -c [channel] -i [interface]</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Step 4: After trying automatic pins it will show up WPS password/pin.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Step 5: Enjoy !!</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Some of the tools that can be used in wireless hacking</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">1.

From its origins that involved physically hiding communications and using invisible inks, it has now moved into the digital world, allowing people to hide critical information into seemingly secret files.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">It may not be as popular as cryptography, but steganography still has important applications. So let’s jump in and discuss what steganography is, the history behind it, how it differs from cryptography, its major use cases, and how it can be detected.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Difference between steganography and cryptography</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Steganography is focused on hiding the presence of information, while cryptography is more concerned with making sure that information can be stored in unreadable form. When steganography is used properly,<strong> no one – apart from the intended recipients – should be able to</strong> <strong>tell that there is any hidden communication taking place</strong>. This makes it a useful technique for situations where obvious contact is unsafe.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">In contrast, cryptography tends to be used in situations where the participants aren’t concerned if anyone know that they are communicating but they need the messages or files they are sending to be hidden so that no eavesdropping is possible or noone else can read the messages.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Let's understand with an example-If you were an activist who’s been imprisoned and you need to communicate with your organization, the logistics can be challenging. The authorities may monitor everything going in and out of your cell, so you need to hide any kind of communication going on from the cell.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">In this kind of situation, steganography would be a good choice. It may be challenging with the resources you have at hand, but you could write a plain sounding letter with a hidden message concealed with different font types or other steganographic techniques.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Let's understand you are a diplomatic person who needs to send some secret information without other knowing so we need to use steganographic techniques to achieve this task.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">If attackers try to intercept the communication, they will <strong>only have access to the ciphertext, and not what the two parties are actually saying</strong>.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">&nbsp;</p><h4><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(32,33,34);\">Hiding Files behind Image:</span></h4><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255,255,255);color:rgb(32,33,34);\">Step 1.

This fundamental wave phenomenon is known as branched flow. It was first observed for electrons and for microwave cavities and it is generally expected for waves with vastly different wavelengths. Branched flow may act as a trigger for the formation of extreme nonlinear events and as a channel through which energy is transmitted in a scattering medium.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;\">When a beam of light is passed through a soap bubble it could behave in an unexpected way. The light may split into branches like a tree, creating many narrower beams in a phenomenon that could be used to study the curvature of space-time.This strange branching behaviour has been observed in several different types of waves, but never before in visible light. Mordechai Segev at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa and his colleagues fired a laser across a membrane made up of soap, similar to a normal soap bubble to observe visible light branching for the first time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;\">“It was observed for the first time” says Segev. “It was a complete surprise in the lab.” The soap membrane had random variations in its thickness, so the researchers expected the laser beam to separate out into disordered speckles.Depending on the structure of the medium, different things can happen to waves travelling through; they can attenuate, disperse, bend, spread, or continue flowing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;\">For branching flow, a few properties are required. The structure of the medium has to be random, and the spatial variations in the structure need to be larger than the wavelength of the flow. It also has to vary smoothly.If all these conditions are met, small perturbations and fluctuations in the structure can scatter the flow, causing it to split.These thickness variations produce the colourful patterns in soap bubbles and can act as the perturbations that deflect light in a flow, causing that flow to split and branch.</span></p>",

There are numerous articles on the web&nbsp;to show you how to backup your system.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Step 2: Create a live USB/disk of Ubuntu</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The next thing you need to do is to create a live USB or disk.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Step 3: Make a partition where Ubuntu will be installed</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Assuming that you have a fresh system, the first thing we need to do is to make a&nbsp;partition to install Linux.&nbsp;The 256 GB in my system was already had several partitions from manufacturer but mainly for backup and other purposes. Main partition was C drive, of around 220 GB, where Windows 8.1 was installed.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">If you have just one partition like this, you need to make some free space out of it for Linux. If you have several partitions of considerable size, use any of them except C drive because it may erase the data.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">To make a partition in Windows 10, go to Disk Management tool. You can find disk management tool by searching for ‘disk’ in Control Panel.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">In the Disk Management tool, right click on the drive which you want to partition and select <strong>shrink volume</strong>. In my case, I shrank the C drive to make some free space.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">You can leave the free space as it is. We shall use it while installing Ubuntu.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Step 4: Disable fast startup in Windows [optional]</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Windows 8 introduced a new feature called “fast startup” for quick boot. While it is not mandatory, it would be better to have it disabled.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> &gt; <strong>Power Options</strong> &gt; <strong>System Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong> and unchecked the <strong>Turn on fast startup box</strong>.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Step 5: Disable secure boot in Windows 10 and 8.1</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">This is the most important step. The new <strong>secure boot</strong> feature of Windows 8, originally intended for security feature for rootkit viruses, prevents dual booting of Windows with Linux. To dual boot Windows 8 with Linux, we must disable secure boot in UEFI.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><strong>Step 6: Installing Ubuntu along with Windows 10, 8.1</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Once you have disabled secure boot, it’s time to install Ubuntu. I hope you already created the live USB as mentioned in step 2. Plug in the USB and boot the system from it.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">To boot from USB, will have to choose boot from USB option from within Windows itself. Either with PC Setting (like for UEFI) or pressing shift key while clicking on Restart.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">Once you have booted in the live USB, you will be presented with option to try or install Ubuntu. Click on install. You will be presented with few screen options&nbsp;to choose the language.

Eventually, the densest material sank inward in the forming planet, creating the layers that exist today—core, mantle, and crust. Although the core is predominately iron, seismic data indicates that some lighter elements like oxygen, silicon, sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen, were dissolved into it during the differentiation process. Over time, the inner core crystallized and has been continuously cooling since then.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">Silicates are predominant in the mantle, and after oxygen and iron, silicon is the third-most abundant element in the Earth, so it is a likely option for one of the main lighter elements that could be alloyed with iron in the core. Led by Wen-Pin Hsieh of Academia Sinica and National Taiwan University, the researchers used lab-based mimicry of deep Earth conditions to simulate how the presence of silicon would affect the transmission of heat from the planet's iron core out into the mantle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">\"The less thermally conductive the core material is, the lower the threshold needed to generate the geodynamo,\" Goncharov explained. \"With a low enough threshold, the heat flux out of the core could be driven entirely by thermal convention, with no need for the additional movement of material to make it work.\"</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:transparent;color:#000000;\">The team found that a concentration of about 8 weight per cent silicon in their simulated inner core, the geodynamo could have functioned on heat transmission alone for the planet's entire history.Looking forward, they want to expand their efforts to understand how the presence of oxygen, sulfur, and carbon in the core would influence this convection process.</span></p>",

But before the release of the first ever Star Wars film that changed the world, every major toy company like Hasbro, Mattel, Parker Brothers turned them down.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Why you ask, well at that time, it was ideal to shop for toy deals about 2 years before the release while George Lucas, the man behind it all, wanted to keep everything a secret in an attempt to avoid any knock offs. With only 2 months to go, toy companies were reluctant to make any invest as meeting the deadline would be an impossible task.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">During this time, a small company Kenner stepped up. They loved the script and Bernie Loomis the head of Kenner felt that Star Wars was toyetic. Toyetic is something which has a great playable quality. So, they gave it a shot. A deal was struck were Kenner got 95% of sales revenue while Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox got only 5% as they didn’t have any other options left and considering how big Star Wars became it was the best deal Kenner could have made.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The film was out, and it broke all the box office records. But there were no toys available in the market with a huge demand. Christmas was here and the company was still not ready with the products as at that time it took at least a year to get into production. Therefore, they came up with a two-part solution.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">First, they did something called label slapping, which was taking any toy already produced and putting a Star Wars sticker on it and now you have a Star Wars toy in hand. They also produced anything which can be made quickly. There were picture-based products like puzzles board games etc. as these did not require any safety checking.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Second, they made a risky decision to sell the kids an early bird certificate package which was basically an empty box with a promise that they will be the first to get a set of figures in the whole galaxy. This was a master stroke from Kenner as the toys were a hit. Industry wide sales were up by 8% all because of a Toy product no one was initially backing.&nbsp;</p>",

The true hackers amongst our societies have an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Boredom is never an object of </span>a <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\">challenge for hackers. They have an almost anomalous ability to absorb, retain, and exert vast amounts of knowledge with regard to intricate details. In 1969, Bell Labs employee Ken Thompson invented UNIX and permanently changed the future of the computer industry. Then in the very early 1970s, Dennis Ritchie invented the computer programming language “C” which was specifically invented to be used with UNIX.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#4d4e53;\">They used the elusive and expensive IBM 704’s at MIT to innovate, explore, create new paradigms, and try to expand the tasks that computers could accomplish.</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#4d4e53;\">These MIT students – along with other early hackers – were interested only in exploring, improving,</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#4d4e53;\">modifying according to their own needs and testing the limits of existing programs. In some cases, these hacks even produced programs that were considerably better than the pre-existing ones, as was the case with Dennis Ritchie’s and Keith Thompson’s UNIX operating system.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\">No one seemed to mind hackers back in the 1960s when this was the most widely accepted reputation. In fact, most people had no idea what hacking was.</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\">Hackers emerged out of the artificial intelligence labs at MIT in the 1960s. A network known as ARPANET was founded by the Department of Defense as a means to link government offices. In time, ARPANET evolved into what is today known as the Internet.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\">In the 1970s, “Captain Crunch” devised a way to make free </span>long-distance<span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\"> calls and groups of phone hackers, later dubbed “phreakers” emerged. Throughout the 1970s and halfway into the 1980s, XEROX’s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) spit out fresh new innovations such as the laser printer and LANs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\">During the 1990s, Kevin Mitnick was arrested after being tracked down by Tsutomu Shimomura. The trials of Kevin Mitnick were of the most publicized hacker trials in hacker history.</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#333333;\">As hackers and time progressed, hackers found ways to exploit holes in operating systems of local and remote machines.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#222222;\">In 1991,</span><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\"> PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a powerful, free encryption tool was released by Philip Zimmerman. The software quickly becomes the most popular encryption package in the world.</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">Rumours appear regarding the computer virus ‘Michaelangelo’, coded to launch its destructive payload on March 6th.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">In 1993,</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">The Mosaic web browser was released along with Microsoft released Windows NT. In 2001,</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">CodeRed worm was released. It spreads quickly around the world, infecting a hundred thousand computers in a matter of hours.</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">All this continued with various versions of viruses released and hacking gained popularity with some people considering it a cool profession and various hackers came together to share their hacking knowledge with each other which led to the formation of Infosec.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">With the number of tools increasing their protection from malicious hackers is also needed in every domain be it Artificial Intelligence or Software Engineering to many other domains.</span> <span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:#232627;\">Hacking will continue to shape the future and shall gain more popularity with the passage of time.&nbsp;</span></p>",

It provides a sustainable model towards the clothing industry by offering a partnership to the consumer and change the world together.&nbsp;</p><p>2.

Firstly, it attracts the attention of the consumer through a surprising statement that contradicts the purpose of ads by suggesting the consumer not to buy the product showcased.&nbsp;</p><p>b. Second, its interest is generated through humor as the viewer is puzzled by the statement and searches for the explanation. It keeps the viewer engaged by what both the company and the consumer will do in this unique partnership or initiative. while doing this it also showcases the benefits of the products they make.&nbsp;</p><p>c. Third, a desire to be the positive change in the world, do the heroic thing, and be a part of something bigger than themselves by being a part of this partnership is invoked in the viewer.&nbsp;</p><p>d.

In choosing arenas, the strategist needs to indicate not only where the business will be active, but also how much emphasis will be placed on each.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Vehicles:&nbsp;</strong>Beyond deciding on the arenas in which the business will be active, the strategist also needs to decide how to get there. If we have decided to expand our product range, are we going to accomplish that by relying on organic, internal product development, or are there other vehicles—such as joint ventures or acquisitions— that offer a better means for achieving our broadened scope? If we are committed to international expansion, what should be our primary modes, or vehicles—Greenfield startups, local acquisitions, licensing, or joint ventures? Failure to explicitly consider and articulate the intended expansion vehicles can result in the hoped-for entry's being seriously delayed, unnecessarily costly, or totally stalled.</p>",

Rather, they require executives to make up-front, conscious choices about which weapons will be assembled, honed, and deployed to beat competitors in the fight for customers, revenues, and profits. Achieving a compelling marketplace advantage does not necessarily mean that the company has to be at the extreme on one differentiating dimension; rather, sometimes having the best combination of differentiators confers a tremendous marketplace advantage.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Staging:&nbsp;</strong>Decisions about staging can be driven by a number of factors. One, of course, is resources. Urgency is a second-factor affecting staging; some elements of a strategy may face brief windows of opportunity, requiring that they are pursued first and aggressively. A third factor is the achievement of credibility. A fourth factor is the pursuit of early wins.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Economic Logic:</strong> At the heart of a business strategy must be a clear idea of how profits will be generated—not just some profits, but profits above the firm's cost of capital. It is not enough to vaguely count on having revenues that are above costs. Unless there's a compelling basis for it, customers and competitors won't let that happen. The most successful strategies have a central economic logic that serves as the fulcrum for profit creation.</p>",

Dell created an extremely low-cost culture organization, selling to customers directly and building to order instead of keeping any inventory.
